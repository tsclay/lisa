## About

Lisa is a CRUD application designed for entities in the hospitality industry to share their experiences with their less-than-savory guests.

The impetus for this app is not the negative experience borne of subpar customer service, but of self-induced negativity from the guest. Colloquially, these kinds of guests are described as "Karens". This app will help in communicating and discussing these negative experiences.

## Cool features

Create, update, and delete entries relating to a guest who is also stored in the PMS used by the resort/hotel.

Create user accounts and comment on these entries. Comments include user's name, comment, an image, and timestamps. Users can edit and delete their comments as well!

## Technologies

The app is a fullstack app running on Node.js with MongoDB as the database. Express.js and Mongoose.js are used to organize the code and thought process.

Datetime display is happily powered by Moment.js because the native Date object in JS sucks. (╯°_°）╯︵ ┻━┻

Bootstrap and some jQuery helpers are used for CSS. 

## What's next

Give users the ability to upload an image to use as their profile picture.

Allow users to reply to other users' comments.
