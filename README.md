## About

Lisa is a CRUD application designed for entities in the hospitality industry to maintain clean, concise records of negative guest experiences.

The impetus for this app is not the negative experience borne of subpar customer service, but of self-induced negativity from the guest. Colloquially, these kinds of guests are described as "Karens". This app will help log and track your Karens.
